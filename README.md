# Arduino UNO 1WD robot
1WD robot managed by the Arduino UNO microcontroller to:
- drive a single motor controlled by the (somewhat old!) 'MH Electronics' UNO motor shield;
- provide object detection using a 5V powered HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor; 
- early development to also implement a 'line following' method; and
- to provide system control/operation using two slide switches

This project is documented in some more detail [here](https://onlinedevices.org.uk/Arduino_Uno_1WD_robot) and the designs for all the 3D prints are also available from [here](https://www.printables.com/model/1255122-arduino-uno-1wd-robot-components).

Working code can be downloaded from the Arduino_IDE_code folder.
